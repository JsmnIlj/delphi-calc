# delphi-calc
A calculator, written in Delphi, for studying purposes. I wanted to get in touch with the Delphi programming language and this is my first little project.
I used the following tutorial as a base: https://delphi.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Calculator_Tutorial
Made some minor changes to it, everything's written down in the comments.

Feel free to give me some feedback or play around with it on your own. :)
